# Backgrounds
This project was conducted to start building a roadmap for my data/ business analytics career. To not only find optimal jobs for me but jobs that are highly valued by employers.

Data provide by [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights
on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs? 
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data
analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# What Tools I Used
- **SQL:** programming language used to transform, modify and extract data from multiple databases

- **PostgreSQL:** database management system to handle all job posting data

- **Visual Studio:** chosen editor and database manager to create queries and interact with data 

- **Github & [Git](https://git-scm.com/):** critical for project version control, tracking changes and sharing insights/ queries on a public platform

# The Analysis
Each query looks at certain aspects of the job market for data analysts exploring high valued jobs and skills based on various metrics such as high paying salaries, in demand skills, with remote work options.

### 1. Top paying Data Analyst jobs
Data was extracted for the top paying data analyst roles, regardless of other Job metrics such as skills and job demand
```sql
-- selected the most important columns and removed NULL salary values
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title_short,
    company_dim.name AS company_name,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM job_postings_fact
-- If would be interesting to add company information so lets add left join
-- then add company name in the SELECT section above ^^
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location LIKE '%Anywhere%'
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```

#### Key insights:
- **Outlier Salaries:** Top 10 highest paying jobs ranged significantly from $184,000 to $650,000 USD
- **The Job Titles varied** significantly and found no common trends among specialization and salary
- **The Companies also varied** significantly from Meta to Smart Asset, indicating a valued interest in data analysts in multiple industries

### 2. Top paying job skills
Finding the most popular skills that are associated with highest paying annual salaries. This helps understand what skills employers value for high compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title_short,
        salary_year_avg,
        company_dim.name
    FROM job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND job_location LIKE '%Anywhere%'
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
-- We want to join top_paying_jobs data and skills data and we rows with NULL skills, therefore INNER JOIN
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
```

#### Key insights:
- **SQL** is the most commonly highest paid skill with a count of 8
- **Python** is also very frequently a high paying skill with a count of 7
